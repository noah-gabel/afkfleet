//! The server's router (Plan.md P6.7, P7.11, Appendix B): every route,
//! registered through the route registry ([`super::routes`]), behind the
//! middleware stack.
//!
//! | Route | Access | Handler |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `GET /health/live` | public | always 200: the process runs and answers |
//! | `GET /health/ready` | public | 200 when the database answers ([`HealthService::ready`]) |
//! | `GET /api/openapi.json` | public | the `OpenAPI` document, only in dev mode ([`openapi`](super::openapi)) |
//!
//! The health routes have no `/api/v1` prefix. Both answer `200` with an
//! empty body; a failed readiness check answers like any store failure:
//! `busy` (503) when the database is busy, `internal` (500) otherwise, with
//! nothing of the cause in the response.
//!
//! Every API route is registered through the registry, so it can't exist
//! without its access, its rate-limit class and its entry in the `OpenAPI`
//! document. The document's own route isn't listed in it.
